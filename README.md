# Kit
MCUni's Network Management System

## Broadcast
Broadcast fetches network broadcast messages from MCUni's network control centre.

## Carl
Carl is a replicate of the popular Carl bot on Discord. At the moment all it does is send "ew" to people who send "pog" or "kek" in chat. Somehow, he's
ascended into the 4th dimension and is a time traveller.

## Events
Events allows the server staff team to send in-server uniform broadcasts around the time of events.

## Status
Status sends automatic status updates to MCUni's network control centre, informing them of server startups, shutdowns, crashes, etc.
