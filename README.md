## Broadcast
Broadcast fetches network broadcast messages from MCUni's network control centre.

## Carl
Carl is a replicate of the popular Carl bot on Discord. He responds to certain messages in chat with "ew" or "hey" depending on what
they are. Somehow, he's ascended into the 4th dimension and is a time traveller. That's a feature, not a bug apparently.

## Events
Events allows the server staff team to send in-server uniform broadcasts around the time of events.

## Status
Status sends automatic status updates to MCUni's network control centre, informing them of server startups, shutdowns, crashes, etc.

## ItemManager
Adds custom items, crafting and furnace recipes.

## Help
A custom help system designed to hide security sensitive plugins whilst still directing users to useful help pages.

## PlayerDeath
A system that records a player's death location & cause and reports back to the player.
